# Plugin Name: Authorization Test Plugin

WordPress custom authorization plugin written for testing


The plugin has its own settings page, counting failed login attempts, and after authorization performs a redirect to the link specified on the settings page in the form "/wp-admin/{field_value}". 
Additionally, a checkbox has been added to the settings page, which allows you to enable/disable the ajax mode for the login form. 
Additionally, the login page has been stylized.
